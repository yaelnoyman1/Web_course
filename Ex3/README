In order to run the project locally, several steps must be taken.

- run npm i

- Edit the .env file:
  1.Add the database uri(CONNECTION STRING)
    example: "mongodb+srv://yael:yael@cluster0.jx7gw.mongodb.net/test://localhost:27017"
  2.add the local address of the client side (index.js)
    example: 'http://127.0.0.1:5500' 

- If your database is empty
  Run the following command once  
  node src/db/load-db.js    

- Edit the index.js file in line 7, you must insert there the port number that the server uses.

- Run the index.html file on a *live-server or another way 

- If you use visual studio code there is a folder with launch.json and you can run the server using the debugger
  Another way is to run the server.js file using node 
  example: node src/server.js 
  
- If you don't see the file .env and .vscode then allow the system to see hidden files.



---------------------------------------------------

* Note that each command should be write in the correct path for the project

* The project was built that the client side runs on a separate port from the server.
  A live server is a convenient option to run a client side locally
